Sir Michael Atiyah claims to have proved the Riemann hypothesis.
This is not some internet crank,
but one the towering figures of mathematics in the second half of the 20th century.
The thing is, he's almost 90 years old.

According to New Scientist, Atiyah is set to present his "simple proof" of the Riemann hypothesis
on Monday at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany.
Atiyah has received two awards often referred to as the Nobel prizes of mathematics,
the Fields medal and the Abel Prize;
he also served as president of the London Mathematical Society,
the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
